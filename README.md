======================

Use smartphone-screens to get immediate feedback on how well the students understand the topic.
Every student can hold up its smartphone to signal its comprehension of the material:
* Green: Everything is understood
* Yellow: Almost there
* Red: I'm puzzled

Let several people answer multiple-choice-questions at the same time. Hide the answer until everyone choosed one answer.
